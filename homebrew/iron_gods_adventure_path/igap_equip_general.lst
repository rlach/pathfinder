Inferno Pistol
	PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Inferno Pistol
	TYPE:Firearm.One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.OneHanded.Fire
	COST:2500
	WT:2
	CRITMULT:x2
	CRITRANGE:1
	DAMAGE:1d6
	WIELD:OneHanded
	RANGE:30
	SOURCEPAGE:Fires of Creation p. 60
	QUALITY:Capacity|1 canister
	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge
	QUALITY:Special|touch
	DESC:An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistol. Unlike a laser pistol, which uses an intensely focused beam of light to burn a target, an inferno pistol is much less elegant—it generates a blob of molten, red-hot material and fires what appears to be a burning pellet of fire with a soft hissing sound. This material is consumed swiftly in firing, leaving behind nothing but ash and painful burns on anything it strikes.
	SPROP:On a critical hit, a shot from an inferno pistol also inflicts 1 point of burn damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). An inferno pistol has a maximum range of 5 increments.

Neural Inhibitor

	SOURCEPAGE:Fires of Creation p. 60
	QUALITY:Capacity|10
	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hit
	DESC:While powered down, this sturdy, 2-foot truncheon functions as a light mace.
	SPROP:Once it is activated (this is a swift action that consumes 1 charge), a high-density power core housed in the weapon’s head generates a high-pitched whine that causes momentary disorientation in a creature struck. Each time the weapon hits a target, it consumes 1 charge and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or suffer trauma to its central nervous system. For 1 round, a creature that fails its saving throw takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and Will saving throws, as well as a –4 penalty on concentration checks. The duration of this effect stacks with multiple hits from the neural inhibitor. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Power Relay
	TYPE:Technological Artifact
	WT:50
	SOURCEPAGE:Fires of Creation p. 60
	QUALITY:Capacity|10
	QUALITY:usage|See text
	DESC:A power relay is a valuable device that allows the long-distance transmission of energy from a nearby generator to a device that can make use of it. Every power generator has a built-in power transmitter that allows for the transmission of power to a nearby power receiver, but an external power relay is required to send this energy beyond the generator’s limitations.
	SPROP:A power relay consumes 10 charges when it is activated (this is a full-round action), after which it automatically links to the closest generator within 1,000 feet that has an available yield. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. The power relay consumes 1 charge of the generator’s available yield per hour to maintain its own power supplies, and can be programmed to transmit any remaining charges of available yield to any object capable of receiving broadcast power, to a maximum distance of 150 miles. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. Power transmitted by this device is lost unless the device is programmed to transmit to a specific target capable of accepting a charge in range. Before a power relay can transmit, it must be linked to the target of its transmission to establish the transmission protocols. This consumes 10 charges and takes 1 minute to complete. Once completed, the distance between the power relay and the target of its transmissions can vary up to its maximum range. A small screen on the side of the power relay provides constant updates on the link, including bearings, distances, and the nature of the object to which it is linked. This device essentially functions as a power generator that provides an hourly yield of charges to its target. For example, if a power relay that provided a yield of 40 charges was linked to a laser pistol, that laser pistol could be fired 40 times per hour without needing an additional charge. Power relays can only function a limited number of times before their delicate internal mechanisms burn out. Each tim ea power relay is used to initiate a new energy transfer, there’s a cumulative 2% chance it burns out and becomes useless. Once a new transfer begins, a power relay can maintain that link between the generator and its target indefinitely (as long as there’s always an available yield of at least 1 charge from the generator to keep itself powered). Note that a power relay has built-in signal boosters, and thus the range of its transmissions cannot be further increased through the use of additional signal boosters.

Proximity Helmet
	TYPE:Technological Gear.Slot_Head.Headgear
	COST:4000
	WT:2
	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
	QUALITY:Capacity|10
	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour
	DESC:This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but the wearer’s mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted faceplate provides a heads-up display when activated.
	SPROP:When activated, the helmet’s external motion sensors pick up on sudden movements and subtle visual cues, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice movingtargets within 60 feet. A secondary setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a loud chirping sound near the wearer’s ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. This noise is loud enough to waken the wearer from sleep, but not loud enough to awaken nearby sleepers.

Vitality Serum
	TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological Gear
	COST:500
	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
	DESC:The glass receptacle of this injector contains 1 dose of a bright-yellow serum.
	SPROP:When injected into a creature (this is a standard action), the substance grants immunity to low radiation for 1 hour, and a +5 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against other radiation effects for that duration. In addition, it heals 1d4 points of Strength damage caused by radiation poisoning. Vitality serum cannot cure Constitution drain caused by radiation poisoning.

Universal Serum
	TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological Gear
	COST:400
	SOURCEPAGE:p.61
	DESC:A viscous, blue serum fills the receptacle attached behind the nozzle of this metallic injector.
	SPROP:Three small panels on the side of the injector light up one at a time when touched— selecting a color (red, blue, or green) is a swift action. The injector contains only 1 dose of universal serum. Injecting the serum is a standard action that heals the recipient of 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect depending upon the current color selection. Red grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Blue grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. Green grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. The enhancement bonus lasts for 3 minutes, after which the recipient of the serum becomes fatigued for 1 hour. If the recipient receives more than 1 dose of universal serum in a 24-hour period, the healing effect still occurs but no enhancement bonus is granted; instead, the recipient immediately becomes fatigued for 1 hour.

Envoy's Mouthpiece
	TYPE:Technological Gear.Goods.Clothing.Resizable
	COST:2000	WT:1
	SOURCEPAGE:Lors of Rust p.62
	QUALITY:Capacity|10
	QUALITY:Usage|1/hour
	DESC:Originally worn by translators, messengers, and diplomats, these objects were always constructed to appear elegant and beautiful. An envoy’s mouthpiece is a circlet worn across the mouth, with slender arms that reach along the jaw to wrap around the wearer’s skull and hold the device in place. Two thin earpieces extend up from the band to slip unobtrusively into the user’s ears once a mouthpiece is donned.
	SPROP:When created, an envoy’s mouthpiece is encoded with a specific single language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of the wearer, the mouthpiece translates that language into Androffan. In addition, any words spoken in Androffan by the wearer are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between the wearer and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy’s mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other than the one it has been programmed to translate, but a newly created mouthpiece could, in theory, translate languages into something other than Androffan. An envoy’s mouthpiece automatically records any words spoken through it, allowing anything said through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button on the lower right side. Up to 30 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner. Holding the button down for a full round erases any currently stored conversations.

Gas Grenade
	TYPE:Technological Gear
	WT:1
	SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.62
	QUALITY:Usage|disposable
	QUALITY:Capacity|1
	DESC:A gas grenade is a small, cylindrical device that is designed to be thrown as a splash weapon or fired from a grenade launcher.
	SPROP:Before being thrown by hand, the grenade must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with a click of a button at the center of that dial. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder’s next turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a gas grenade detonates, it creates a 20-foot spread of foul-smelling toxic gas. All creatures in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. The gas created lingers in the area for 5 rounds, and any creature that succeeds at its initial save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on its turn. The gas is not thick enough to obscure vision, and is a poison effect. The vapors can be dispersed in 1 round by moderate or stronger wind.

Memory Facet - Inhibitor
	TYPE:Technological Artifact
	SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.62
	DESC:A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb that’s adorned at one end by a metal cap fitted with prongs and plugs. The crystal’s interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering amount of programming—these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and at the time Divinity began its mission, they were primarily used for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal’s connectors into an appropriate slot in an AI’s core processor or a robot under the AI’s control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and processors it controls—where a memory facet is installed makes little difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in their most secure locations. Each memory facet contains a unique combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence’s capabilities. In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created—items intended to disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI’s personality or even its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI’s code. Once installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round actions.
	SPROP:An inhibitor facet is unusual among memory facets in that it isn’t intended to augment an AI at all, but rather to hinder and impair its functionality. When installed, an inhibitor facet reduces an AI’s Charisma by 4 and imposes a –4 penalty on all skill checks, saving throws, initiative checks, and attack rolls. The effects of multiple inhibitor facets do not stack.

	DESC:A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb that’s adorned at one end by a metal cap fitted with prongs and plugs. The crystal’s interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering amount of programming—these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and at the time Divinity began its mission, they were primarily used for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal’s connectors into an appropriate slot in an AI’s core processor or a robot under the AI’s control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and processors it controls—where a memory facet is installed makes little difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in their most secure locations. Each memory facet contains a unique combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence’s capabilities. In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created—items intended to disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI’s personality or even its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI’s code. Once installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round actions.
	SPROP:This memory facet bolsters an AI’s ability to do harm, granting a +4 bonus on all damage rolls. In addition, while the AI controls an aggregate, the facet grants the aggregate a rogue’s sneak attack ability (+2d6) and bleeding strike talent.

	DESC:A mind burner is a pistol with a dishlike adornment at the tip of its barrel. When this weapon is fired, a pulse of white smoke pools in the dish an instant before a thin beam of white light lances out to strike its target. A mind burner is silent when fired, but stray particles from the mind-altering beam can cause those nearby to catch unexpected scents associated with powerful memories—the odor of a bouquet of flowers given to one’s first lover, the scent of a parent’s perfume or sweat, or maybe even the odor of a favorite food that hasn’t been eaten in years. These fragmentary memories generally have no additional effect on those who experience them, but at the GM’s discretion, they could cause the resurfacing of repressed memories or forgotten fears.
	SPROP:On a successful hit, a mind burner causes intense headaches that dull the senses and weaken willpower. Each hit deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, but also imposes a –2 penalty on Perception checks and a –1 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These penalties stack with themselves, up to a maximum penalty of –10 on Perception checks and –5 on mind-affecting saving throws. A creature can resist the penalties caused by a shot from a mind burner with a successful DC 14 Will save; otherwise, the penalties persist for 1 hour after the previous successful shot. On a critical hit, a mind burner’s penalties are doubled along with its nonlethal damage.

Soothe

	SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.63
	DESC:This strange, pink, gel-like substance is generally contained in a small glass jar that holds 1 dose. A single dose of soothe dulls pain and creates a euphoric sensation, particularly when applied to an open wound. Rubbing a dose of soothe onto one’s skin or imbibing the faintly citrusflavored stuff cures 1 point of damage, but rubbing a dose onto a wound received in the last minute heals the user of 1d8 points of damage. In addition, for the next minute, the user becomes immune to bleed damage and gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. As a somewhat unusual and disturbing side effect, wounds healed by soothe tend to form raw, unsightly scars, giving the appearance of the wound still being fresh but disturbingly bloodless. Soothe has a further side effect—the stuff is slightly addictive, and those who use it run the danger of developing a habit. Soothe’s side effect of transforming wounds into raw, ugly scar tissue tends to make those who abuse the drug-like pharmaceutical increasingly into hideous monstrosities over time. In fact, some subcultures, like the Smilers of Scrapwall, use this side effect to make themselves appear more ferocious, and openly encourage self-mutilation followed by healing via of this strange substance.

Compact AI Core
	TYPE:Artifact.Technological Gear
	WT:8
	SOURCEPAGE:Valley of the Brain Collectors p.62
	QUALITY:Capacity|240
	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour
	DESC:A compact AI core is a flat sheet of semi-translucent pale blue material 10 inches wide and 20 inches long, contained in a frame of adamantine and horacalcum.
	SPROP:One of the narrow ends of the device features a small touch-sensitive panel and several sockets to connect to external devices as needed, although the compact AI core can communicate with most electronic devices and robots wirelessly at a range of 60 feet. The primary purpose of a compact AI core is to house the staggering amount of data needed to store an artificial intelligence without compromising or degrading its core programming. Most processors capable of storing this amount of data are significant in size, but a compact AI core is small enough to carry in one hand. An AI stored within a compact AI core loses all implicit connections to the source AI. An existing AI can copy itself into a compact AI, but once the copy is complete the new AI within the compact AI core becomes a duplicate but separate entity that may develop different needs and desires than the source. As a result, many AIs resist the idea of duplicating themselves in such a manner so as to avoid possible conflicts or competition. An AI faced with the certain destruction of its core processors, of course, may well resort to using a compact AI core as a method of escape and survival, but the unpredictable changes to personality that are possible during such a transfer may well prompt some AIs to gracefully accept oblivion instead. In a way, it’s better to view the relationship between an AI and its duplicate in a compact AI core as more akin to that of parent and child than as twin siblings or clones. More often, a compact AI core is used to house an entirely new AI creation, either one programmed from scratch (a discipline lost to the denizens of Divinity today, and one that was thus never available to the inhabitants of Golarion), or one created by the transfer of a living creature’s mind via neurocam. An AI can use a compact AI core to seize control of a robot to transform it into an aggregate (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 59), but no more often than one robot can be controlled at a time, and the compact AI core must remain within 60 feet of the aggregate or control is lost. An AI who attempts to seize control of a robot in this manner can do so as a standard action, and the target can resist the attempt with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the AI’s CR + its Charisma modifier). A compact AI core has 3 sockets capable of accepting one memory facet each. A compact AI core consumes power at the rate of 1 charge per hour, but does not suffer any memory loss or damage if all 240 charges stored within it are consumed—once the compact AI core receives more energy, the AI within immediately regains the ability to interact with the world. While without power, an AI becomes dormant—it may experience something akin to strange dreams, but it cannot be communicated with and is not aware of the passage of time. A compact AI core has hardness 20 and 80 hit points. If a compact AI core becomes broken, the AI it contains takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws and skill checks. If a compact AI core is destroyed, any AI housed within is destroyed as well. A compact AI core that is destroyed can be repaired via a wish or miracle, or perhaps via complex technological machinery hidden deep in the most secure of Divinity’s wreckage—but restoring an AI previously housed in the core to functionality requires a second miracle or wish—such an act might be beyond even the machinery of Divinity.

Touch of Avolition

	SOURCEPAGE:Valley of the Brain Collectors p.63
	SPROP:This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition is in fact an example of migo technology—as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item’s effect. Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition’s fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early. Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user’s willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim’s Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn’t remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells. A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do not stack.

The triggering mechanism is built for a neh-thalggu’s pincers and tendrils, but it can be fired by a humanoid with a bit of work.
	SPROP:Creatures other than neh-thalggu take a –2 penalty on attack rolls with a fleshnet cannon. Fleshnet cannons are built for Large creatures, and smaller creatures take additional penalties as appropriate when using these weapons.
	SPROP:When a fleshnet cannon is fired, it makes a low, wet, sucking noise as the barrel seems to convulse an instant before expelling a glob of pink fleshy material. This glob expands rapidly so that by the time it strikes its target, the flesh unfurls into a net. Unlike a typical net, this net doesn’t trail ropes, nor does it have a maximum range of 10 feet.
	SPROP:The net automatically entangles a creature of Huge or larger size it hits. As soon as it entangles a creature, and then again at the start of every round that follows for the next 5 rounds, the fleshnet squeezes and crushes the target, dealing 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as it excretes a powerful soporific—the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being rendered unconscious for 2d6 minutes. A fleshnet does not continue to crush a sleeping or unconscious foe.
	SPROP:An entangled creature can escape a fleshnet with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 10 hit points and DR 10/slashing; it can be burst with a successful DC 28 Strength check (also a full-round action).

A crystal button on the shaft allows for a secondary attack: a beam of plasma that fires from the forked tip of the spade.

	SPROP: If used to enhance cyberfiber muscles, a thoracic nanite chamber, or wirejack tendons an implant mesh must be installed on that piece of cyberware before the item is implanted in a body. If the check to implant the mesh into the other cybernetic item fails, the implant mesh is destroyed.
	SPROP: Once a piece of cybertech has been augmented by an implant mesh, that cybertech implant no longer counts as taking up a body slot for the purposes of installing other cybernetic devices into that slot. Enhancing a cybernetic device with an implant mesh doesn’t alter the device’s install DC, but does increase its implantation value by 2. For example, a mark II thoracic nanite chamber enhanced with an implant mesh could be implanted in a creature that already has cyberfiber muscles or dermal plating, but the augmented thoracic nanite chamber’s implantation value increases to 6.

#When Running PCGen, you can select "Help > Documentation > List Files > List File Tag Index > Equipment File tags" to find
#out how the tags in the races file work. Some of the tags used here are global tags. You will see an alphabetical listing
#of all PCGen tags to the left of the documentation window. You can find the global tags there as well.
#
#

#
#####1st Example

#Dagger		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Finesseable.Ranged.Thrown.Simple.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.Dagger		COST:2	WT:1		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:2		DAMAGE:1d4		EQMOD:STEEL		WIELD:Light		RANGE:10	SIZE:M

#####
#
#####2nd Example

#Saddlebags		TYPE:Goods.Container.Mount.Resizable		CONTAINS:UNLIM|Any=UNLIM	COST:4	WT:8		SOURCEPAGE:Equipment

#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.
