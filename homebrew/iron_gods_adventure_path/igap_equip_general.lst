#####1st Example

#Dagger		PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Dagger		TYPE:Weapon.Resizable.Melee.Finesseable.Ranged.Thrown.Simple.Standard.Piercing.Slashing.Dagger		COST:2	WT:1		CRITMULT:x2		CRITRANGE:2		DAMAGE:1d4		EQMOD:STEEL		WIELD:Light		RANGE:10	SIZE:M
Inferno Pistol							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Inferno Pistol																TYPE:Firearm.One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.OneHanded.Fire									COST:2500	WT:2															CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6		WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:30			SOURCEPAGE:p.60																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|1 canister	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|touch				SPROP:An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistolTG. Unlike a laser pistol, which uses an intensely focused beam of light to burn a target, an inferno pistol is much less elegant—it generates a blob of molten, red-hot material and fires what appears to be a burning pellet of fire with a soft hissing sound. This material is consumed swiftly in firing, leaving behind nothing but ash and painful burns on anything it strikes. On a critical hit, a shot from an inferno pistol also inflicts 1 point of burn damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). An inferno pistol has a maximum range of 5 increments.
Neural Inhibitor								PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mace																		TYPE:Light Melee.Light.Melee.Weapon.Technological Gear.performance.Simple.Standard.Bludgeoning.Mace.Hammer									COST:1200	WT:2															CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:1d6		WIELD:Light											SIZE:M	SOURCEPAGE:p.60																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hit			SPROP:While powered down, this sturdy, 2-foot truncheon functions as a light mace. Once it is activated (this is a swift action that consumes 1 charge), a high-density power core housed in the weapon’s head generates a high-pitched whine that causes momentary disorientation in a creature struck. Each time the weapon hits a target, it consumes 1 charge and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or suffer trauma to its central nervous system. For 1 round, a creature that fails its saving throw takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and Will saving throws, as well as a –4 penalty on concentration checks. The duration of this effect stacks with multiple hits from the neural inhibitor. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Power Relay					TYPE:Technological Artifact						WT:50							SOURCEPAGE:p.60																								QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:usage|See text	SPROP:A power relay is a valuable device that allows the long-distance transmission of energy from a nearby generator to a device that can make use of it. Every power generatorTG has a built-in power transmitter that allows for the transmission of power to a nearby power receiverTG, but an external power relay is required to send this energy beyond the generator’s limitations. A power relay consumes 10 charges when it is activated (this is a full-round action), after which it automatically links to the closest generator within 1,000 feet that has an available yield. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. The power relay consumes 1 charge of the generator’s available yield per hour to maintain its own power supplies, and can be programmed to transmit any remaining charges of available yield to any object capable of receiving broadcast power, to a maximum distance of 150 miles. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the power relay. Power transmitted by this device is lost unless the device is programmed to transmit to a specific target capable of accepting a charge in range. Before a power relay can transmit, it must be linked to the target of its transmission to establish the transmission protocols. This consumes 10 charges and takes 1 minute to complete. Once completed, the distance between the power relay and the target of its transmissions can vary up to its maximum range. A small screen on the side of the power relay provides constant updates on the link, including bearings, distances, and the nature of the object to which it is linked. This device essentially functions as a power generator that provides an hourly yield of charges to its target. For example, if a power relay that provided a yield of 40 charges was linked to a laser pistol, that laser pistol could be fired 40 times per hour without needing an additional charge. Power relays can only function a limited number of times before their delicate internal mechanisms burn out. Each tim ea power relay is used to initiate a new energy transfer, there’s a cumulative 2% chance it burns out and becomes useless. Once a new transfer begins, a power relay can maintain that link between the generator and its target indefinitely (as long as there’s always an available yield of at least 1 charge from the generator to keep itself powered). Note that a power relay has built-in signal boosters, and thus the range of its transmissions cannot be further increased through the use of additional signal boostersTG.
Proximity Helmet			TYPE:Technological Gear.Slot_Head.Headgear	COST:4000			WT:2						SOURCEPAGE:p.61		QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge/hour			SPROP:This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but the wearer’s mouth and chin. The interior of the tinted faceplate provides a heads-up display when activated, with each charge providing enough power to function for 1 hour of continuous use. During this time, the helmet’s external motion sensors pick up on sudden movements and subtle visual cues, granting the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice movingtargets within 60 feet. A secondary setting on the helmet adds an audible alarm that creates a loud chirping sound near the wearer’s ear whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. This noise is loud enough to waken the wearer from sleep, but not loud enough to awaken nearby sleepers.
Vitality Serum																											TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological Gear																COST:500																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.61		SPROP:The glass receptacle of this injector contains 1 dose of a bright-yellow serum. When injected into a creature (this is a standard action), the substance grants immunity to low radiation for 1 hour, and a +5 alchemical bonus on all saving throws against other radiation effects for that duration. In addition, it heals 1d4 points of Strength damage caused by radiation poisoning. Vitality serum cannot cure Constitution drain caused by radiation poisoning. 
Universal Serum																											TYPE:Pharmaceutical.Technological Gear																COST:400																																					SOURCEPAGE:p.61		SPROP:A viscous, blue serum fills the receptacle attached behind the nozzle of this metallic injector. Three small panels on the side of the injector light up one at a time when touched— selecting a color (red, blue, or green) is a swift action. The injector contains only 1 dose of universal serum. Injecting the serum is a standard action that heals the recipient of 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect depending upon the current color selection. Red grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Blue grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. Green grants the recipient a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. The enhancement bonus lasts for 3 minutes, after which the recipient of the serum becomes fatigued for 1 hour. If the recipient receives more than 1 dose of universal serum in a 24-hour period, the healing effect still occurs but no enhancement bonus is granted; instead, the recipient immediately becomes fatigued for 1 hour. 

#Lords of Rust
Envoy's Mouthpiece																											TYPE:Technological Gear.Goods.Clothing.Resizable																			COST:2000	WT:1																																				SOURCEPAGE:Lors of Rust p.62																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1/hour		SPROP:Originally worn by translators, messengers, and diplomats, these objects were always constructed to appear elegant and beautiful. An envoy’s mouthpiece is a circlet worn across the mouth, with slender arms that reach along the jaw to wrap around the wearer’s skull and hold the device in place. Two thin earpieces extend up from the band to slip unobtrusively into the user’s ears once a mouthpiece is donned. When created, an envoy’s mouthpiece is encoded with a specific single language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of the wearer, the mouthpiece translates that language into Androffan. In addition, any words spoken in Androffan by the wearer are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between the wearer and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy’s mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other thanthe one it has been programmed to translate, but a newly created mouthpiece could, in theory, translate languages into something other than Androffan. An envoy’s mouthpiece automatically records any words spoken through it, allowing anything said through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button on the lower right side. Up to 30 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner. Holding the button down for a full round erases any currently stored conversations.
Gas Grenade																													TYPE:Technological Gear																					WT:1																																				SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.62																																																								QUALITY:Usage|disposable	QUALITY:Capacity:1		SPROP:A gas grenade is a small, cylindrical device that is designed to be thrown as a splash weapon or fired from a grenade launcher. Before being thrown by hand, the grenade must be primed with a quick twist of a dial at one end and then armed with a click of a button at the center of that dial. The grenade detonates at the beginning of the wielder’s next turn, hopefully in the area targeted. When a gas grenade detonates, it creates a 20-foot spread of foul-smelling toxic gas. All creatures in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become nauseated. This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. The gas created lingers in the area for 5 rounds, and any creature that succeeds at its initial save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on its turn. The gas is not thick enough to obscure vision, and is a poison effect. The vapors can be dispersed in 1 round by moderate or stronger wind.
Memory Facet					TYPE:Technological Artifact							SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.62																								SPROP:A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb that’s adorned at one end by a metal cap fitted with prongs and plugs. The crystal’s interior contains sparkling veins of glittering light. A memory facet is a high-capacity storage device capable of containing a staggering amount of programming—these devices were rare and difficult to craft, and at the time Divinity began its mission, they were primarily used for one purpose: storing and transporting the staggeringly complex code required to program and enhance artificial intelligences. To use a memory facet, one needs simply to insert the crystal’s connectors into an appropriate slot in an AI’s core processor or a robot under the AI’s control. A core processor or robot can hold as many memory facets as it has available slots, but at any one time, an AI can benefit from a maximum number of memory facets equal to its CR divided by 4 (minimum 1). The AI can gain the benefits of memory facets installed in any of the robots and processors it controls—where a memory facet is installed makes little difference, but most AIs prefer to keep their memory facets installed in their most secure locations. Each memory facet contains a unique combination of emotions, knowledge, traits, and personality quirks designed to enhance and bolster an artificial intelligence’s capabilities. In rare cases, destructive memory facets were created—items intended to disable or damage an artificial intelligence in case of emergencies. An AI immediately gains all of the advantages (and any disadvantages) associated with a particular memory facet as soon as it is installed (this is a full-round action). Memory facets can change an AI’s personality or even its alignment. An AI can try to resist having a memory facet added to its code by attempting a DC 20 Will save. If the AI is successful, the memory facet ceases functioning for 1d4 rounds, and must be extracted and reinstalled to make a second attempt to changing the AI’s code. Once installed, a memory facet is difficult to remove; removing one requires either a successful DC 25 Strength check to wrench free or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check. Both attempts are full-round actions. Listed below are rules for the memory facets in this adventure—future adventures will contain rules for other types of memory facets, and in the final adventure, the PCs can use their collected facets not only to fight against Unity, but also to augment and enhance their own AI ally, the oracle Casandalee. Aggression Facet: This memory facet enhances an AI’s offensive protocols, imparting a +2 bonus on all attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and granting Deadly Aim and Power Attack as bonus feats when the AI is controlling a robot. Ego Facet: An ego facet bolsters an AI’s sense of selfesteem and sense of worth, imparting a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws and a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks, as well as granting Toughness as a bonus feat when the AI is controlling a robot. Inhibitor Facet: An inhibitor facet is unusual among memory facets in that it isn’t intended to augment an AI at all, but rather to hinder and impair its functionality. When installed, an inhibitor facet reduces an AI’s Charisma by 4 and imposes a –4 penalty on all skill checks, saving throws, initiative checks, and attack rolls. The effects of multiple inhibitor facets do not stack.
Mind Burner							PROFICIENCY:WEAPON|Mind Burner																TYPE:Firearm.One-Handed Ranged.Ranged.Weapon.Technological Gear.OneHanded									COST:8000	WT:2															CRITMULT:x2	CRITRANGE:1	DAMAGE:special		WIELD:OneHanded								RANGE:20			SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.63																																																								QUALITY:Capacity|10	QUALITY:Usage|1 charge	QUALITY:Special|touch				SPROP:A mind burner is a pistol with a dishlike adornment at the tip of its barrel. When this weapon is fired, a pulse of white smoke pools in the dish an instant before a thin beam of white light lances out to strike its target. A mind burner is silent when fired, but stray particles from the mind-altering beam can cause those nearby to catch unexpected scents associated with powerful memories—the odor of a bouquet of flowers given to one’s first lover, the scent of a parent’s perfume or sweat, or maybe even the odor of a favorite food that hasn’t been eaten in years. These fragmentary memories generally have no additional effect on those who experience them, but at the GM’s discretion, they could cause the resurfacing of repressed memories or forgotten fears. On a successful hit, a mind burner causes intense headaches that dull the senses and weaken willpower. Each hit deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, but also imposes a –2 penalty on Perception checks and a –1 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These penalties stack with themselves, up to a maximum penalty of –10 on Perception checks and –5 on mind-affecting saving throws. A creature can resist the penalties caused by a shot from a mind burner with a successful DC 14 Will save; otherwise, the penalties persist for 1 hour after the previous successful shot. On a critical hit, a mind burner’s penalties are doubled along with its nonlethal damage.
Soothe		TYPE:Goods.Drug.Consumable.Technological Gear	COST:200	SOURCEPAGE:Lords of Rust p.63	SPROP:Contact; Addiction minor; EFFECTS 1 minute; DAMAGE: 1d2 Wisdom Damage; FORTITUDE DC 12; This strange, pink, gel-like substance is generally contained in a small glass jar that holds 1 dose. A single dose of soothe dulls pain and creates a euphoric sensation, particularly when applied to an open wound. Rubbing a dose of soothe onto one’s skin or imbibing the faintly citrusflavored stuff cures 1 point of damage, but rubbing a dose onto a wound received in the last minute heals the user of 1d8 points of damage. In addition, for the next minute, the user becomes immune to bleed damage and gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. As a somewhat unusual and disturbing side effect, wounds healed by soothe tend to form raw, unsightly scars, giving the appearance of the wound still being fresh but disturbingly bloodless. Soothe has a further side effect—the stuff is slightly addictive, and those who use it run the danger of developing a habit. Soothe’s side effect of transforming wounds into raw, ugly scar tissue tends to make those who abuse the drug-like pharmaceutical increasingly into hideous monstrosities over time. In fact, some subcultures, like the Smilers of Scrapwall, use this side effect to make themselves appear more ferocious, and openly encourage self-mutilation followed by healing via of this strange substance.

#####
#The Dagger is an Example of a weapon, while the Saddlebags is an item that is set up to be used as a container for other
#items. The first field is the item's name and is required.
#
#The PROFICIENCY tag is only used with weapons, armor and shields. It tells PCGen what Weapon Proficiency name to use from the weapprofs.lst, armorprofs.lst or shieldprofs.lst file.
#
#The TYPE tag is used for many filtering and PRExxx tags. TYPE:Armor items should also have the type of SLOTS it uses. This
#is usually TYPE:Suit. TYPE:Container is a special type name. It activates the CONTAINS tag in the item. Every TYPE:Weapon
#item must be also have either TYPE:Melee or TYPE:Ranged (TYPE:Weapon.Melee.Foo). TYPE:Double is a special weapon tag. It
#activates three ALTxxx tags for the second head statistics.
#
#The CONTAINS tag is used to define how much and what a container can hold. Any object with CONTAINS must also be TYPE:Container
#for the CONTAINS tag to be activated.
#
#The COST tag sets the cost of the item.
#
#The WT tag is holding the item's weight.
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the item. This will be displayed in PCGen.
#
#CRITMULT, CRITRANGE, DAMAGE, WIELD, and RANGE are tags that are associated with weapons. They can be used to set up the
#various weapon stats.

#The SIZE tag determines the size of the Item. F=Fine, D=Diminutive, T=Tiny, S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large, H=Huge, G=Gargantuan,
#C=Colossal.

#The EQMOD tag calls an equipment modifier to be applied to the base item before looking at other tags. You will need to use
#the equipment modifier's KEY with this tag, not it's name.
